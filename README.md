# Getting Started with Mall Assassins

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The backend is built on top of Firebase. This document is intended to provide you the necessary details to get the mall assassins app code on your local machine and in a state ready for you to run it, contribute your own changes to the code, and integrate those changes into the master version of the app.

## Setting Up Github for Collaboration

The first step to getting started here is to set up your Github account and set up git on your local machine. 

### For Git Aficionados
If you are already familiar with Github and git workflows and are ready to get going, go ahead and fork this repository and then git clone the fork onto your local machine. Make some basic change to the code and submit a pull request (PR) against the main branch of this current repository to prove that you know how these things work. Your PR will get rejected, and once it does, go ahead and move on to the next step.

### For Less Experienced Git users
First, try to get a general overview of what git and Github are - ask the person next to you what they are and why they're useful. Make sure you understand the following terms in particular:
- git clone
- git pull
- git branch
- git add
- git commit
- fork
- pull request
- merge conflict
Once you feel like you have a decent grasp of these ideas, go ahead and move on to the [Github setup doc]([url](https://github.com/Octophi/mall-assassins/blob/main/github-setup.md)) to actually do the setup.

## Setting up npm and JavaScript 

Check your work by running npm -v and node -v. If these run 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


## Resources

Below is a list of useful tutorials if you want to familiarize yourself with the technologies used in this app. If you feel confident in your code abilities, you might just be able to get by with ChatGPT and reading existing parts of the code here. If you want more structured resources though, here's a few resoureces that you might find useful to reference.

### Basic Web Development
- [Basic blog on web dev]([url](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/html-css-and-javascript-explained-for-beginners/))

### React
- [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/): Basic documentation
- [Learn React Tutorial](https://react.dev/learn): I'd recommend you start here if you've never seen React before

### Firebase
- [AngularFire CodeLab]([url](https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web#0)): This is using Angular rather than React but you can get some basic ideas of how to call into Firebase from JavaScript
